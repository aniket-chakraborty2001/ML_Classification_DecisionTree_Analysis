# ML_Classification_DecisionTree_Analysis
Consider the 'drug200.csv' file. It has a column named 'Drug'. It is the classification class in the data set. Using the feature set, I develop decision tree to easily classify the unknown or a future item in its class. Classification is a Supervised Machine Learning model that help to classify an unknown or future item by observing similarity. Now, KNN is also used for this purpose. But using decision tree reduces the length of KNN process as it does not require multiple test to determine best model.
